An array is made up of a cells that are used to store a value. Each array can hold a list of values. All the values in an array need to have same data type. Like `String` variables, the index of an array starts with 0. There are two ways to initialize an array:

1. `datatype[] arrayname = {valueOne, valueTwo, valueThree};`<br>

 The simplest way to create an array is enclosing its values in curly braces separated by commas. 

2. `datatype[] arrayname = new datatype[arraylength];`<br>

 We give an array a certain length and adhere to it throughout the whole program. The length cannot be altered once given.

You can access the elements in the array using: `arrayname[index]`. This indicates a specific element inside the array using the index. You can then manipulate the value it holds.
