The length of an array equals the number of elements it can hold. The last index of an array is `array.length-1`. Remember that the `length()` method in the `String` class works differently than `array.length()`.

The length of an array cannot be altered after it is initialized. Please remember this quality when you loop through arrays with for/while statements.
