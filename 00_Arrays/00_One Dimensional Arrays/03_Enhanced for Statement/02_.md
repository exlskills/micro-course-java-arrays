The syntax for an "enhanced for statement" is as follows, `for(datatype variablename : arrayname)`. The "datatype" and "variablename" is what you would put in the first section of a `for` loop, the loop control variable. This creates a new variable that only exists within the "for-each" loop. It is used as the index when accessing the elements of the array.

The "for-each" loop is used when you want to loop through each and every element of the array without missing out an index or accidentally exceeding the last index of the array. When you code a program that only accesses certain elements inside an array, you can still use the "for-each" loop. However, as it requires an extra `if` statement to do so, you may choose to use a regular `for` loop with incrementing/decrementing variables as shown in past topics.
