The `for` statement has the condition `count<exampleVariableOne.length`, which makes sure that every element in the array is added to sum before the `for` loop is terminated. Why do we use '<'? Because the last index of the array is always `array.length-1`, so `count` cannot be equal to or greater than `exampleVariableOne.length`. If we do not specify this, a runtime error may occur.

The `for` loop above is a prime example of the loops used when dealing with one-dimensional arrays. As you master using a `for` loop and accessing the elements in an array, you will start writing more complicated programs that deal with large amounts of data. Being able to iterate through arrays using loops is important because arrays cannot be directly printed to the console. `System.out.println(arrayname)` won't work.
