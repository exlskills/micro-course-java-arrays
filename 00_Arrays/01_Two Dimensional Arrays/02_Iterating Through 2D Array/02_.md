The first `for` loop loops through each row of the 2D array one by one. As the first loop runs through each row, the second (nested) `for` loop inside the first loop loops through the columns one by one. The nested for loops runs row by row, checking each column within the row before moving on to the next row.

Because each row could have different numbers of columns, we need to access the specific column length of the specified row. That is why you see `exampleVariableOne[countOne].length` used within the second nested `for` loop.

The concept of using loops when working with 2D arrays is an essential tool in every programmer's toolkit. Look meticulously through the code above and become comfortable with how each loop fits into the big picture. When you become comfortable with the `for` loop, try using “for-each” loops with 2D arrays.
