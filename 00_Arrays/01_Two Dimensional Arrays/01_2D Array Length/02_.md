We use `arrayname.length` to determine the number of rows in a 2D array because the length of a 2D array is equal to the number of rows it has. The number of columns may vary row to row, which is why the number of rows is used as the length of the 2D array.

When calling the length of a column, we pinpoint the row before using `.length`. The program above checks to see how many columns the first row of the 2D array contains by calling `exampleVariableOne[0].length`. Adjust the '0' to another number to change the row specified.
