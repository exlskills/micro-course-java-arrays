Let's expand our array conversation to two-dimensional arrays. Spreadsheets, web browser screens, images, and many other types of data are in a 2D format, which is why we need arrays that can handle this type of data. A 2D array is laid out in a grid like graph paper, meaning each element is still housed in its own cell like in a 1D array. However, that element is now represented by two different indexes that are both needed in order to specify that cell. Take a look at the 2D arrays below.
