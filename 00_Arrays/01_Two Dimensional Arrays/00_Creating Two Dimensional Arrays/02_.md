Similar to 1D arrays, the index of both row and column start at 0. The first square bracket after the array name specifies the row while the second one dictates the column. All indexes start at 0, so `varOne[0][0]` specifies the first row and the first column. If you have `varOne[3][1]`, you are indicating the element that exists in the fourth row and the second column. Like 1D arrays, all the elements must have the same datatype. Initializing a 2D array is also very similar to initializing a 1D array.

1. `datatype[][] arrayname = new datatype[3][1];`<br>

Creates a 2D array with three rows and one column. 

2. `datatype[] arrayname = {{varOne, varTwo}, {varThree, varFour}};`<br>

Creates a 2D array with two rows and two columns. The rows are separated by commas and enclosed in individual curly braces.
