The syntax for declaring an `ArrayList` is: <br>

 `ArrayList<objectType> name = new ArrayList<objectType>();`. <br>

By default, an `ArrayList` will start out with 10 empty cells. If you want to start with an initial capacity, put a number in the parentheses. This does not limit the size the `ArrayList` can expand to. A benefit of an `ArrayList` is that elements may continue to be added regardless of the original size of the `ArrayList`. The size of the `ArrayList` will automatically increase and no information will be lost.
