Now that we have entered the world of arrays, let's talk about the `ArrayList` class in Java and what it offers in addition to the known capabilities of arrays. An `ArrayList` object contains an array of object references as well as methods for managing the array. The elements of an `ArrayList` must be object references, not primitive data such as `int` or `double`. Take a look at the `ArrayList` of `String` values as an example. The `ArrayList` class has to be imported from the `java.util` package in order for the program to compile without error.
