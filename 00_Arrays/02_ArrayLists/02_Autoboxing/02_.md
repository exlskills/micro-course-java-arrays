Autoboxing automatically converts `int` values to type `Integer` when the program is run. Therefore, regardless of what primitive data type we want to use, as long as we initialize the `ArrayList` with the right object, we can add primitive data types without creating new objects.

Use autoboxing when creating an `ArrayList` of objects that have corresponding primitive data types. It makes coding a lot more simple when debugging the code.
