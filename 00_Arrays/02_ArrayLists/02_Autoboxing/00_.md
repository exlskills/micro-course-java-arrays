"Autoboxing" is a way to work with primitive data types within `ArrayLists` to make your coding easier. If we wanted to create an `ArrayList` of integers, we use `ArrayList<Integer>` because `int` is not an object. However, when we call methods such as `add()` and `set()`, instead of creating a new object `add(new Integer(11));`, we can just write `add(11)` as Java automatically converts `int` into `Integer` for us. Look below for an example of autoboxing.
