These are the important methods to learn for an `ArrayList`:

1. `add(value)` or `add(index,value)`<br>

 Adds an element to the end of an `ArrayList`. The method returns "true" if it is treated as a `boolean` value. When you add a specific index as a parameter, it will add the value at the specified index and move everything else after it up by one index.
 
2. `remove(index)`<br>

 Removes an element from the `ArrayList`. It can return a reference to the deleted element if it is called. The method will shift the other elements down an index to account for the deleted element. 

3. `set(index, value)`<br>

 Combines `add()` and `remove()` by replacing the value at "index" with the new "value"

4. `get(index)`<br>

 Accesses the element at a particular index. 
 
5. `size()`<br>

 Returns the current length of the `ArrayList`. This method is important as the size may change when using the methods above.
